            We all wish we had more power. The power to turn back time, to re-write history and make better decisions, but most importantly, the power to save a life. It may appear that we are on our own to battle uncertain destiny. But what if I were to tell you there's more? 
            <br/><br/>
            There's a way to change your fate, to hold more cards, and take not only your own life, but the lives of those you love into your hands.  No, we cannot go back in time, but we can set forth ripples of change into the future that can alter our coexistence forever. Toxicology and clinical laboratory testing may be one of those portals.

                    <p>
                      A nursing home resident is accidently overdosed with quietipine, an anti-psychotic medication.  While the postmortem blood level of the medication is high, the autopsy pathologist discounts the results because of “postmortem redistribution” and rules that the death was due to old age. When a person dies, there is a leakage of drugs from the organs that falsely creates higher drug levels after death.  The daughter of the deceased suspects foul play, because his nursing home  medication records mysteriously vanish.

                      After decades of living an irresponsible life with recreational drugs, a woman stops abusing drugs and lives a meaningful life.  Unfortunately, before she gives up her reckless lifestyle, she contracts a chronic hepatitis C infection and now needs a life-saving liver transplant.  She is denied this operation because her urine drug test comes up positive for methamphetamine use which she now denies.  We attend a medical convention and learn new information that can save her.

                      An alcohol-intoxicated man causes a traffic accident that kills his childhood friend who was a  passenger in his car.  The driver is charged with vehicular manslaughter.  The crime lab  tests his blood for alcohol 3 days after his arrest.  His  clever defense attorney argues that alcohol was produced in his body by fermentation while it sat at room temperature in the lab. There  is no other alcohol testing conducted to refute this claim.  But is there other objective evidence that can be used to determine the truth?

The analyst suspects that one of the anonymous donors that we regularly test is secretly adulterating his urine sample to invalidate our lab test in order to mask his drug use.  My technologist becomes obsessed with catching this donor and steps beyond the boundaries of his legal and moral responsibilities.

                      A doctor admits to drinking wine the day before she arrives for work.  She is subjected a breath alcohol test. The result suggests that she was drinking that morning. She tells the medical licensing board that she is a slow alcohol metabolizer and contracts my laboratory to prove it.  Following controlled and witness drinking, we measure her alcohol breakdown rate and confirm her unusual metabolism. She is exonerated by the board.  We realize later that she may have cheated.

As adrenaline is a natural compound, its presence is insufficient to verify poisonings. My lab performs research studies on animal models in hopes of proving her guilt.

                      A Taiwanese grandmother picks poisonous mushrooms in California because they are identical in appearance to edible versions back home. She prepares the mushrooms for dinner one night.  Shortly thereafter, she and her grandson both become violently ill. A liver specialist is consulted who knows of experimental treatment for mushroom poisonings.  As this medication is not approved for use in the US, he places an emergency call to the FDA, and gets permission to have this medication flown from Germany overnight.

                      A young soldier is a body builder and spends much of his free time in the gym lifting weights with his fellow recruits. The group ingests a supplement purchased from the Marine Corps store that will assist in their training.  After a few months of ingesting this supplement, the young man suddenly dies of a heart attack.  Such deaths are highly unusual for young individuals who are active and physically fit.
