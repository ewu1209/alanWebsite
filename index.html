No, we cannot go back in time, but we can set forth ripples of change into the future that can alter our coexistence forever. Toxicology and clinical laboratory testing may be one of those portals.

                    <p>
                      A nursing home resident is accidently overdosed with quietipine, an anti-psychotic medication.  While the postmortem blood level of the medication is high, the autopsy pathologist discounts the results because of “postmortem redistribution” and rules that the death was due to old age. When a person dies, there is a leakage of drugs from the organs that falsely creates higher drug levels after death.  The daughter of the deceased suspects foul play, because his nursing home  medication records mysteriously vanish.

                      After decades of living an irresponsible life with recreational drugs, a woman stops abusing drugs and lives a meaningful life.  Unfortunately, before she gives up her reckless lifestyle, she contracts a chronic hepatitis C infection and now needs a life-saving liver transplant.  She is denied this operation because her urine drug test comes up positive for methamphetamine use which she now denies.  We attend a medical convention and learn new information that can save her.

                      An alcohol-intoxicated man causes a traffic accident that kills his childhood friend who was a  passenger in his car.  The driver is charged with vehicular manslaughter.  The crime lab  tests his blood for alcohol 3 days after his arrest.  His  clever defense attorney argues that alcohol was produced in his body by fermentation while it sat at room temperature in the lab. There  is no other alcohol testing conducted to refute this claim.  But is there other objective evidence that can be used to determine the truth?

The analyst suspects that one of the anonymous donors that we regularly test is secretly adulterating his urine sample to invalidate our lab test in order to mask his drug use.  My technologist becomes obsessed with catching this donor and steps beyond the boundaries of his legal and moral responsibilities.

                      A doctor admits to drinking wine the day before she arrives for work.  She is subjected a breath alcohol test. The result suggests that she was drinking that morning. She tells the medical licensing board that she is a slow alcohol metabolizer and contracts my laboratory to prove it.  Following controlled and witness drinking, we measure her alcohol breakdown rate and confirm her unusual metabolism. She is exonerated by the board.  We realize later that she may have cheated.

                      A nurse murders several hospitalized patients with adrenaline overdoses.  The hospital suspects foul play because more than a normal amount of fatalities occur while this nurse is on duty. The DA orders the victims exhumed and tested for evidence of injections.  As adrenaline is a natural compound, its presence is insufficient to verify poisonings. My lab performs research studies on animal models in hopes of proving her guilt.

                      A Taiwanese grandmother picks poisonous mushrooms in California because they are identical in appearance to edible versions back home. She prepares the mushrooms for dinner one night.  Shortly thereafter, she and her grandson both become violently ill. A liver specialist is consulted who knows of experimental treatment for mushroom poisonings.  As this medication is not approved for use in the US, he places an emergency call to the FDA, and gets permission to have this medication flown from Germany overnight.

            Most people know that clinical laboratory tests conducted on blood or urine are essential to hospitals and their doctors in determining if someone is healthy or suffering from a medical problem warranting treatment.  If you are diabetic, a glucose test is important to determine if you need more insulin.  If you have high cholesterol, your doctor will tell you to stop smoking, improve your diet, or ask you to exercise more.  If a person fails to take these measures, a doctor may prescribe statins, which are drugs that reduce the risk for heart attack by lowering a person's cholesterol and lipids.  There are a few tests available to consumers for at-home testing, like glucose monitoring or pregnancy tests however, the vast majority of testing is only conducted in laboratories by professionals.

              How do I know this? For the past 30 years, I have been a clinical laboratory director. My job is to provide the data on lab test results that physicians need in order to medically manage their patients.  As a professor of laboratory medicine at three major medical schools and laboratory director at their affiliated university hospitals, it is also my responsibility to conduct research into human diseases and develop new tests that help improve the diagnosis of these diseases. In the course of my career, I have written over 300 peer-reviewed journal articles in well-known medical periodicals such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, and Circulation.  I have also authored hundreds of book chapters, review articles, editorials, and opinions, and several textbooks on laboratory medicine.  I also am the co-editor-in-chief of Clinica Chimica Acta, a leading journal in clinical laboratory science, and on the editorial board of other scientific and medical journals.  However, I write now to share my insight and life's work with those who are outside of my academic field.

              Toxicology! What You Don't Know Can Kill You is a collection about human cases that involve intoxications by alcohol, prescription and recreational drugs, and natural substances such as plant poisons and herbal medications.  The science for each story is based on true events and cases that I was involved with during my career.   Learn what happen to a person who tries to smuggle cocaine into the US by swallowing bags, how we can catch a nurse who murders her patients with adrenaline, or how an evacuation chute of an airplane may have caused the death of a passenger after a crash.

                      A young woman's mother develops breast cancer and has a mastectomy.  Fearing that she is also at risk, the daughter has her DNA tested for genetic variances.  The test is performed and results are reported electronically to the doctor.  The girl sees the result through the internet first, because the oncologist is on vacation. There is no opportunity for the doctor to discuss the significance of the findings.

                      Hubert Humphrey barely lost to Nixon in the 1968 presidential election because he didn't distance himself from President Johnson's Viet Nam war policies. One year earlier, Humphrey was hospitalized for having bloody urine but there was no cause found.  Ten years later, he dies of bladder cancer.  In 1994, scientists re-examined his biopsy with new tests and determine that confirmed the cancer. I re-write history making this test and diagnosis available in 1968.

            We all know about the dangers of living a modern life. There are risks 
            when we get behind the wheel of a car or when we meet a stranger on 
            the street. We can reduce these foreseen risks if we practice defensive 
            driving or avoid contact with suspicious individuals. There are 
            hundreds of unforeseen risk that we face every day. The world of 
            microbiology falls under this latter category. “Microbiology! Because 
            What You Don’t Know Will Kill You,” is about everyday people who 
            encounter harmful organisms that we cannot see with the naked eye, 
            yet they cause death or serious medical harm to an individual, group 
            or even an entire population. We cannot avoid all of these risks, but 
            with knowledge of their existence, we can better our odds.

            Alan H.B. Wu was born in Doylestown Pennsylvania and spent his first years on a farm in New Jersey.  In the mid 1950s, he moved with his family first to Chicago and then to Morton Grove.  He attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois.  Upon graduation, he entered Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, and dual majored in chemistry and biology.  Given his interest in clinical chemistry, his advisor Professor Harry Pardue, who was one of the first analytical chemists to train clinical chemists, suggested he attend the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana for graduate school.  There he received his doctoral degree in Analytical Chemistry from the late Howard Malmstadt, a pioneer in automation for chemistry. Larry Faulkner, former President of the University of Texas in Austin was on his thesis committee.

              In 1980, Dr. Wu enrolled in the postdoctoral training program in the field of clinical chemistry at Harford Hospital.  His mentors were Drs. George Bowers and Robert McComb, renowned for their work on liver enzymes and calcium testing, Robert Burnett, an expert on blood gas analysis, and Robert Moore, who spent his career on clinical chemistry and endocrinology. In 1982, Dr. Wu became Assistant Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, and Associate Clinical Chemistry Director at Hermann Hospital.  After spending 10 years there, he relocated back to Harford Hospital where he became director of the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory, and Professor of Laboratory Medicine at the University of Connecticut, Farmington, and Professor of Pathobiology and Chemistry at the University of Connecticut, Storrs.  He left in 2004 to become Professor of Laboratory Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and Director of Clinical Chemistry, Toxicology and Pharmacogenomics at San Francisco General Hospital. He is currently a member of the Medical Advisory Board for the California Poison Control Center.  Dr. Wu has four children and lives with his wife in Palo Alto California.
