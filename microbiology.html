            We all know about the dangers of living a modern life. There are risks 
            when we get behind the wheel of a car or when we meet a stranger on 
            the street. We can reduce these foreseen risks if we practice defensive 
            driving or avoid contact with suspicious individuals. There are 
            hundreds of unforeseen risk that we face every day. The world of 
            microbiology falls under this latter category. “Microbiology! Because 
            What You Don’t Know Will Kill You,” is about everyday people who 
            encounter harmful organisms that we cannot see with the naked eye, 
            yet they cause death or serious medical harm to an individual, group 
            or even an entire population. We cannot avoid all of these risks, but 
            with knowledge of their existence, we can better our odds.

                      Early in my career as a clinical scientist, a former doctor from Eastern Europe comes to America and works for me as a laboratory technician.  While performing testing, he has a bad habit of aspirating patient sera into a tube pipette using mouth suction.  On day, he is distracted and he becomes one of the first patients to be infected with this new unknown virus.

                      A surgeon tells his students that hospital-acquired infections of drug resistant bacterial are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the hospital.  He explains that exposure of these microorganisms to widespread antibiotics stimulates mutation enabling them to be resistant.  He learns about a new laboratory test that can be used to reduce the incidence of antibiotic use but is frustrated by the lack of interest for adoption of this test.

                      A graduate student from Viet Nam loses her his girlfriend during the 9-11 attacks.  He is doing research on viral diseases.  In the freezer in at his research lab, he has vials of anthrax. Shortly after 9-11, there were attacks on U.S. citizens when terrorists send sent anthrax through the mail.  He is asked to destroy his supply of the bacterium, but secretly retains one vial for his research work.

                    <p>
                      Upon graduation from medical school, a smart but arrogant student enters a residency program in laboratory medicine.  He selects a professor of clinical microbiology to conduct medical research while still a student.  The study goes awry and he presents falsified data at a national meeting. His advisor uncovers the fraud and confronts the student.

                      A student asks about the history of the “informed consent” process in order for patients to participate in medical research studies.  I describe the Tuskegee Syphilis Trial that took place in the 1930’s and enrolled subjects without consent and without their knowledge.  When antibiotics become available, treatment is withheld.  The rights of patients were violated in the name of medical science.

                      An ambitious ad executive develops stomach ulcers.  He is treated with antacids  but his condition does not improve and he is instructed to reduce his work hours.  Meanwhile, a scientist in Australia are is working on a radically different theory as to how ulcers are formed.  The medical community debunk his theory, leading him to take drastic measures to prove himself his theory.
