Find out what happens to a healthy woman when she finds out she is very likely to get breast cancer, how a blood test catches a terrorist, or how a modern lab test if it were available in 1968 for Hubert Humphrey could have changed the course of American history.

                      A man has a fetish with eating potatoes.  His obsession began in childhood, but now as an introverted adult, his diet consists almost exclusively of raw green tubers.  Then his health begins to decline as a result. His doctor contacted me to see if there are toxins in his blood from the potatoes that could cause his current illness.

                      King George III ruled England during the Revolutionary War. Centuries later, medical scientists conclude that he may have been psychotic because of porphyria, a genetic disease that affects hemoglobin production and produces bluish-purple urine. I re-write history making lab tests and treatments available to treat the King for porphyria when the colonists were revolting.

                      Hubert Humphrey barely lost to Nixon in the 1968 presidential election because he didn't distance himself from President Johnson's Viet Nam war policies. One year earlier, Humphrey was hospitalized for having bloody urine but there was no cause found.  Ten years later, he dies of bladder cancer.  In 1994, scientists re-examined his biopsy with new tests and determine that confirmed the cancer. I re-write history making this test and diagnosis available in 1968.

                    <p>
                      A patient undergoes an elective surgery and is given standard anesthesia.  The operation is stopped because she develops a seizure during the procedure.  She is treated with a fat emulsion that was recently discovered to be useful in drug overdoses, and she is saved.  We perform a research study to determine how this miracle substance works.
